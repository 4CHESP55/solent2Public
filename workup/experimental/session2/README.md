# Introduction to Java Server Pages

One of the oldest but still widely used Java web technologies is Java Server Pages or JSP. 
A java web application server like tomcat can serve a mixture of html and JSP pages and any other content such as images or CSS or javascript which form part of a page.
JSPs are documents which contain a mixture of HTML and Java code.
The java code is used to dynamically change the html which is rendered by the server for each web request.
This is very similar to other web technologies such as PHP. 
The main difference from PHP is that instead of being interpreted each time they are called, 
JSPs are compiled into java code when they are first requested and cached for later use. 
This means that subsequent requests to a JSP page is very fast

The following exercises will introduce you to writing your own JSPs. 

[Exercise 1](../session2/Exercise1.md) is a simple introduction to JSP's. Try this first.

[Exercise 1b](../session2/Exercise1b.md) takes the example exercise further.

Try these exercises on your own first then look at the example code here [webExercise1-answer](../session2/webExercise1-answer)
