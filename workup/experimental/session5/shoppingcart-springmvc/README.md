# Exercise 2 shoppingcart-springmvc

This exercise follows on from the work you did in  [Exercise 1 simple-springmvc](../../session5/simple-springmvc) 

In this exercise you will migrate the code from your shopping cart application to use SpringMVC

We will do this in two parts.

## Part 1
Migrate the simple shopping cart you created in the [session3 shopping cart exercise](../../session3/shoppingcart) 

In this case you only have to migrate one JSP

An example answer is provided [webApplicationExercise2Spring-answer](../shoppingcart-springmvc/webApplicationExercise3-answer )
 but dont look at this until you have tried it yourself.


## Part 2
In session 4 you enhanced the simple shopping cart application to have a navbar using bootstrap 

see if you can migrate [session4 shopping cart bootstrap exercise](../../session4/shoppingcart-bootstrap) to use spring mvc

Again an example answer is provided [webApplicationExercise2Spring-answer](../shoppingcart-springmvc/webApplicationExercise2Spring-answer )
 but dont look at this until you have tried it yourself.
