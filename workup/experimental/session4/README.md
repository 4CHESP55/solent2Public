# Session 4

These exercises follow on from [session3](../session3/) and use the same shopping cart project you created.

If you had trouble completing the exercises yourself, 
you can still use the session 3 answer project [webApplicationExercise2-answer](../session3/shoppingcart/webApplicationExercise2-answer) as your starting point here

In this session we are going to build on our existing shopping cart application to add extra pages and formatting using the bootstrap library.
Later we will be looking at the SpringMVC framework to see how this improves the web design.

Remember you should first copy this folder into your own myPracticeCourseWork folder and do any work there.

## Exercise 1 adding bootstrap
You should complete the exercises in [shoppingcart-bootstrap](../session4/shoppingcart-bootstrap)
